                Paris is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at
                the Paralympics is an open water swimming event in the Seine
                (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the
                City of Amsterdam thinks it is beter than Paris, they want to
                host an event before the Paralympics, snubbing the Parisians.
                The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the
                canals of Amsterdam. You are asked by the municipality of
                Amsterdam to advise on the feasibility of the event from the
                perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an
                environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in
                May.

              <span>
                For this exercise you have chosen a route in Amsterdam for the
                canal swimming event. Preferably you have this route calculated
                using Python. You can set a start point and an end point and
                then try to find a route that has a certain distance (min. 5
                km.)

              <br class="assignment4-text06" />
              <span>
                The Municipality wants you to find a location for the Event
                Headquarters. They decided it would be best if this E.H. is as
                close to the centre of the swimming route. There is a bit of a
                concern for the after party and the stream of visitors. They
                want you to quantify the number of visitors that can reach the
                event and the capacity for festivities after the event.

                • Can you find which bus and tram lines these are, and can you

                It is time to present the swimming route for the Amsterdam
                pre-Paralympics city swim. Now that the external conditions and
                technicalities of water quality, the energy impact of the
                accompanying boats and the overnight stays are discussed, the
                route can be calculated. Obviously, the picturesque canals of
                Amsterdam make the most impact for touristic value and
                instagrammability. Therefore, the swim will be held in the
                Herengracht and the Keizersgracht, from the Leliegracht until
                the Amstel, as presented in Figure 1.

                For the swim event to operate optimally, a headquarters needs to
                be determined. This location must be a central point. To find
                the central point, the centrality must be calculated. Centrality
                is an index weighing certain points to be more ‘central’ or
                important in the network than others, based on a closer distance
                to other points in the whole network. This indicator is taken
                because next to the swimmers, most visitors of the event will be
                walking, therefore it is important to find the shortest walking
                path to the central point from every other corner of the
                swimming route – as done in what is called closeness centrality
                in literature (Zhang &amp; Luo, 2017). Calculating the closeness
                centrality of the whole route gives the address of the
                University of Amsterdam (Spui 21, Amsterdam) as an ideal central
                location. This place is suitable, being a spacious and
                semi-public location. Also, the close ties between the
                university and the municipality support the suitability for
                being the events’ headquarters.

                Accessibility is not only determined by walking distance, as
                stated before, but also by the proximity of public transport to
                the swimming route. Taking the central point (the event’s
                headquarters) as the main bus and tram stop, makes the route
                closely accessible for everyone on foot from there. Buses and
                trams run through the city center of Amsterdam, close to where
                the swimming takes place. The closest tram stop to the events
                head quarters is ‘Koningsplein’ (see Figure 2). Tramline 2
                (Central Station – Oudena) and 12 (Central Station –
                Victorieplein) runs through here. This is the only tram stop
                within 500 meters, further tram stops are visible in Figure 3.
                The bus does not run here.

                The amount of people that can be transported by the tram to
                Koningsplein in one hour is calculated too. The trams 2 and 12
                stop at Koningsplein 12 times in one hour on a weekday, a Sunday
                and on holidays, and this is 14 times on a Saturday. The maximum
                amount of people that travel with both trams on a weekday is
                2010, on a Sunday or on holidays this is 1852 and on a Saturday
                this number goes up to 2055 people.

                While the swimmers are doing their job in the canal, food and
                drinks are essential for the visitors to keep the excitement up.
                Good French wine in café or a good French cheese in a
                restaurant, both indispensable to the Paralympics party.
                Therefore, the restaurants and café’s are presented in Figure 1.
                There are 49 cafes and 154 restaurants within a 10-minute walk
                distance, so about 700 meters away from the end point of the
                race.
