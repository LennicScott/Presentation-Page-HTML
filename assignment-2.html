                The Municipality is worried that the canal- and support boats
                might pollute the air with their diesel engines. Since the
                Municipality wants to create ideal conditions for the swimmers
                so they can set records (always nice for PR), it is your task to
                figure out if their concern is warranted and what should or
                could be done to improve conditions. Next to that, Amsterdam
                wants to advertise this event as a Neutral Energy Event

                To guide the event and its swimmers in the right canals, boats
                are needed to allow mobility on the water for the teams. These
                boats cannot disturb the swimmers nor the environment with
                pollutant exhausts. Furthermore, the event has to be
                energy-neutral.

                Currently, there are 7350 boats registered in the municipality
                of Amsterdam of which an estimate of 15% is emission-free. This
                is measured by looking at the vignettes handed out and corrected
                by taking samples by law enforcement on boats. Most of these
                boats are small (less than 6 meters in length), and of the
                bigger water vehicles (longer than 7 meters), less than 4% are
                electric (Municipality of Amsterdam. 2023a). However, by 2025
                all boats have to be electric, meaning that a big switch will be
                made (Jacobs, et al., 2016).

                Peak times for boats are in July and August (weeks 27 to 35),
                but as seen in figure 1, the amount of boat hours goes up after
                January (week 5) and surpasses 1200 hours with easter holidays
                (week 15). Most boat hours are made on the weekend, specifically
                on Saturday. Boat hours for pleasure boats peak between 18:00
                and 19:00, for passenger ships around 16:00, and there are no
                boats between 23:00 and 6:00). This data measured in the canals
                of Amsterdam by an Automatic Identification System (AIS-data),
                that looks into the use of the canals by manned boats
                (Municipality of Amsterdam, 2023a). Moreover, most boats are
                unmanned by a professional, and are for own use, as seen in
                Figure 2. However, the data seen in Figure 1 still gives a good
                implication for the use of boats throughout the year.

                Many boat hours mean many exhaust fumes from combustion engines.
                The retrofitting of an electric motor in existing boats is
                calculated by the municipality of Amsterdam (2023a) in their
                council letter, and averages 4000 euro for the most used boat:
                the small pleasure boat (the green bar in figure 2). The energy
                use then, is also estimated from 3 kW to 10 kW for bigger boats.

                Currently, there are 7350 licensed boats in the Amsterdam
                canals, with power between 3 kW and 12 kW, as shown in table 2.
                Taking an average boat of 7 kW of 1000 kg (see table 2) that is
                fairing with an economic speed of 7 km/h for 6 hours (the whole
                day), this would mean that the amount of energy used is: 1000 kg
                * 1,1 * 6 hours = 6.6 kWh (Marinaut, n.d.). If all boats would
                farm on electric energy for a full day, this would take 6.6 kWh
                * 7 359 = 48 510 kWh.

              <br class="assignment2-text045" />
              <br class="assignment2-text046" />
              <span>
                This amount of energy can be compared to other big events that
                use a lot of electricity. For example, the Amsterdam Light
                Festival uses 15 000 kWh over the course of 53 days with 20
                light installations (Amsterdam Light Festival, 2023), the boats
                thus use 3 times more energy than that festival. Another event
                that uses a lot of light, as well as sound, is a concert: the
                mean amount of energy used is 26 400 kWh (NPO Radio 2, 2015),
                which comes closer to the amount used by the canal boats. Far
                exceeding is a music festival such as Lowlands, which uses 300
                000 kWh of electricity (Entertainment Business, 2015), which is
                6 times more than the boats would use. Moreover, events like
                this have mostly a big carbon footprint due to the food
                produced, resources needed for food and drinks, and the
                transport needed to bring the materials, visitors, and artists
                to the location (NPO Radio 2 ,2015). This footprint is much
                bigger than the boat business can be.

                For boat owners, the switch to electric motors is a must, since
                the municipality bans combustion motors in the city after 2025
                (Jacobs, et al., 2016). The owner of Reederij Kooijman, who owns
                32 tourist boats for city tours of more than 11 meters, admits
                that the retrofitting is a very expensive undertaking, as it
                costs around 250 000 euros per boat. However, the municipality
                mandates it, so the entrepreneur Kooijman has to, just like all
                the other canal boats (Wall, 2018). Though 11% of the boat
                owners in Amsterdam said to stop fairing their boat when it had
                to be fully electric, and 37% said to then allocate their
                fairing outside of the canals so they can keep using the
                combustion engine. Furthermore, 34% of the boat owners said to
                were ready to invest between 500 and 5000 euros to make the boat
                emission-free, and 44% said to not be ready to invest anything
                (Municipality of Amsterdam, 2022). That electric boats are
                cleaner, more relaxing to drive, and easier to upkeep, might be
                an unknown message still (Marinaut, n.d.).

                In accordance with the Canadian guidelines for open-water
                swimming (2015), several escort boats are needed for feeding and
                tracking the athletes. They state that “gas fumes can be
                dangerous and annoying” (p. 6) and impede the swimmer, therefore
                the boats need to be electric indeed. For a course of 5 km, as
                in the case of the Amsterdam Paralympic canal swim, one boat per
                500 meters is allowed, so 10 boats. The boats have to keep a
                safe distance from the swimmers and not run faster than 5 km per
                hour (Swimming Canada, 2015).

                If for the event the boats should be powered with clean,
                renewable electricity, a certain amount of wind turbines or
                photo voltaic panels are needed. Electric boats of 5 meters,
                with a weight of 850 kilograms (including 4 people and the
                motor) with an external motor use 3kW, meaning a battery of 4
                kWh is enough for fairing the whole day (with 4 kWh one can
                reach 30 kilometers in a speed of 7 km/h). The amount of kWh
                used for 10 boats, one day of fairing is then 850 kg * 1.1 * 6
                hours * 10 boats = 56.1 kWh (Marinaut, n.d.).

                According to the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics (2023a) in
                the province of North Holland 12 wind turbines provided a
                normalized amount of 1835 million kWh in 2022. For one wind
                turbine daily this is 418 949 kWh of provided energy. One wind
                turbine then can power 7 467 times the electricity for the boats
                that day (418 949 / 56.1 = 7 467). This amount of energy is
                currently provided by both wind turbines on land and at sea in
                the energy region of North Holland (Province of North Holland,
                2022b). In the city of Amsterdam, there are 28 wind turbines, as
                seen in figure 3, all located in the western harbor area. The
                plan is also to place at least three new wind turbines in this
                area, as the turbines are “fitting in the industrial
                surroundings of the western harbor area”, according to Sander
                Mager, manager at the local waterboard (Amsterdams Dagblad,
                2022). Additionally, three wind turbines are to be placed in the
                Noorder IJplas, as the call for more renewable energy keeps
                growing and the resistance for health reasons too (van Zoelen,
                2022). Accommodating this facility in the city is therefore
                possible but harder because of the complexity of installation.
                But because of the high return of electricity, wind turbines are
                a very good provider of clean energy, and therefore feasible.

                As for solar panels. One solar panel generates about 0.8 kWh of
                electric energy per day (Dak Profijt, n.d.). Therefore, we need
                0.8 kWh * 56.1 kWh = 45 solar panels running that day to provide
                enough electricity for the boats. According to data by the
                Province of North-Holland (2022a) in Amsterdam 717 Mega Joule =
                199 kWh per inhabitant is provided in 2022 by sun energy every
                year, meaning that the boats in the event would take away the
                energy provided by the sun for 56.1 kWh / 199 = 0,2 inhabitants
                for a year. The placement of solar panels is currently
                considered easy, as roofs and walls support them and the
                municipality promotes the installation of new panels too
                (Municipality of Amsterdam, n.d.). Accommodating this facility
                in the city is therefore very possible and feasible.

                The effect of internal combustion engine motors of boats on
                water quality in the Amsterdam canals is currently so bad that
                the municipality wants to ban diesel motors altogether (Jacobs,
                et al., 2016). This pollution exists out of noise pollution and
                carbonized fuel pollution (Morandin, et al., 2015). The latter
                is specified into the exhaust of particulate matter (PM10,
                PM2.5), Nitrogen oxide (NOx), and black carbon. This pollution
                from boats is a local source next to the traffic on roads (cars,
                trucks, etc) (Boogaard, et al., 2011). The effect on water
                quality if there are fewer boats using fossil fuels is mostly
                less deposition of Nitrogen oxide (Artz, et al., 2021).

              <span>
                For biodiversity, the biggest source of disturbance comes from
                the whirl of the propulsion of boats that causes the silt to
                swirl up and consequently block sunlight from hitting the canal
                foundation where water plants can thus not grow. High levels of
                nitrogen oxide have a similar effect, as algal blooms are prone
                to flourish in eutrophicated water (enrichment of the water with
                NOx), and then block sunlight from entering the water. Fish are
                attracted by water plants, and the lack thereof creates a very
                unattractive living area for aquatic organisms and low
                biodiversity (Municipality of Amsterdam, 2023b).
